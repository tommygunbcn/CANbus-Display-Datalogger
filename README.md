# CANbus-Display-Datalogger
A Display for an Electric Vehicle that uses CAN bus messaging. Also , there is the possibility of sending via UART some values, making this an inexpensive and intersting tool for developement

So, Do you need to visualize data flowing in  your CAN bus?

I needed to, so I built this simple Display with this elements:

- arduio UNO board ( actually I used seeeduino because of the micro USB connector)
- Display used in this project is the 2,8" TFT touch shield, v2.1 by seeed studio
- Can BUS shield v1.2 by seeed studio
- A small joystick like this
